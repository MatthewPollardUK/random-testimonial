# Fetch a random testimonial

I created this to put my new JavaScript skills to the test. I wrote it using ES6 vanilla JavaScript.

- It uses  Tool Carton's testimonial API (https://testimonialapi.toolcarton.com/)
- The shown testimonial is selected at random.
- The same testimonial isn't shown twice in a row.
- The CSS is responsive.
